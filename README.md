## FAIO - Feather All-in-One Switch

What if you could have a universal switch interface that could support different types of switches all-in-one device? 

FAIO is an assistive technology device which developed to provide a modular solution for those with high level of physical disabilities to interact with touch screen devices and personal computers.

FAIO provides an affordable and open-source all-in-one switch interface that supports many different types of switches such as Sip-and-Puff, Adaptive Switches, Braille and offers an interface for developers to create their own modular input switches through Grove system.

Adaptive switches are the key components for many of those with physical disabilities to communicate and access computers.There are many types of switches available which are used by the users based on their abilities.These switches use a switch interface to communicate with the host device and the available switch interfaces don't support all types of switches.This means the users may need to purchase additional switch interfaces depending on their switch and host device which is costly and requires additional setup.

## Usage

All the necessary information to create your own FAIO is provided in the github.
